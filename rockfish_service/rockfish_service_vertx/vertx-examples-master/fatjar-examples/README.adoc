= Fatjar examples

Here you will find examples showing Vert.x fatjar in action.

== HTTP/2 fatjar

An HTTP/2 server fatjar using Boring SSL engine and embedding the server key/certificates in _pem_ format.

The pom.xml uses the Maven shade plugin to assemble the application and all it's dependencies into a single "fat" jar.

To build with Maven

    mvn package

To run the fat jar:

    java -jar target/http2-fatjar-3.3.0.jar

The build.gradle uses the Gradle shadowJar plugin to assemble the application and all it's dependencies into a single "fat" jar.

To build with Gradle

    ./gradlew shadowJar

To run the fat jar:

    java -jar build/libs/http2-fatjar-3.3-fat.jar

NOTE: embedding the key in the jar is a discouraged practice - it is done purposely to keep the example simple
